;; A note about the internal representation we work with for paths in this code.
;; ---
;; We work with vectors of path components, basically (that is, strings of the
;; pieces between File/separator). If the path is an absolute path, the first
;; component will be :root, so that if during processing everything else is
;; removed, we know to render "/" and not ".". Similarly, if the path is a
;; relative path, the first component will be :cwd. The rest of the vector is
;; the path components as strings. In this file, I'll call this data structure
;; a "path vector."
